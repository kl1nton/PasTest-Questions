	2. Interosseous membrane
	3. Deep fascia of the forearm
- One tendon is given off to each of the fingers
	- These insert onto the **Palmar Base of the Distal Phalynx**	
### Q5 (A) #36869
A 67-yo man undergoes split thickness skin grafting for a full thickness burn to his back.

What is the best description of a split thickness skin graft?

	A. Takes a variable amount of epidermis, leaving behind the epidermal appendages
	B. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis
	C. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis and underlying fat
	D. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis, underlying fat and fascia
	E. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis, fat, fascia and a cuff of muscle
	
#### Answer: A. Takes a variable amount of epidermis, leaving behind the epidermal appendages - TRUE
- A split skin graft (SSG) takes the epidermis from the donor area, leaving behind skin appendages 
	- So that the area is able to heal by secondary intention
- Graft is avascular
	- Relies on **neovascularisation** at recipient site
	- This takes between 5 and 7 days
- In order for the graft to 'take' at its new site, wound bed must be
	1. Clean
	2. Vascularised
	3. Free of infection

### Q6 (A) #36870
A 2-yo child is admitted to paediatric ED with malaise, rash, vomiting and fever. Mum reports that she has been off her food for the preceding 24-hrs and has been running a low-grade temperature.

Compression of which nerve is responsible for his Sx?

	A. Axillary nerve
	B. Median nerve
	C. Musculocutaneous nerve
	D. Radial nerve
	E. Ulnar nerve

#### Answer: B. Median nerve - TRUE
- Formed by the lateral and medial cord of the brachial plexus
	- Median Nerve has contribution rom C6, C7, C8 and T1
- It enters the Hand via the Carpal Tunnel
	- Anatomical compression in this area can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome
- Just as it exits the tunnel
	- Median Nerve gives off the _Recurrent Motor Branch_
	- Avoid damaging this in surgical release of the flexor retinaculum

### Q8 (A) #36872
A 79-yo lady attends A&E having collapsed onto a radiator. She has a full thickness burn to her buttock.

What is the definition of a full thickness burn?

	B. Dorsal scapular artery
	C. Scapular artery
	D. Thoracoacromial artery
	E. Thoracodorsal artery

#### Answer: E. Thoracodorsal artery - TRUE
- Thoracodorsal Artery us a branch of the Subscapular Artery
	- Supplied Latissimus Dorsi
- The muscle is raised high into the axilla with protection of the neurovascular bundle
	- A skin paddle is taken with it
	- The Serratus Branch is often clipped and dividied
- The muscle is then passed through the axilla from the back to reach the front
	- Flap can be monitored by pressing on skin paddle to assess capillary refill
- Failure rates are low given that this is a pedicled flap
	- **No microvascular anastomic** connections

	B. FNA
	C. Groin dissection
	D. Open node biopsy
	E. PET scan
	
#### Answer: E. PET scan - *FALSE*
B. FNA (fine needle aspiration biopsy)
- She should have an FNA for cytology
	- May be done under USS if the node is small
- If the results are inconclusive, discuss option of open node biopsy
- If positive, she will require elective groin dissection with whole body CT scan
- **Little evidence** to suggest than removal of pelvis lymph nodes _reduces mortality_

### Q14 (A) # 36879
A 78-yo lady is awaiting a right-side groin dissection for metastatic spread of melanoma. During her perioperative investigations she is noted to have a DVT in her right leg.

What should happen next in this case?

	B. Continue surgery, keep her on warfarin
	C. Continue surgery, start her on IV heparin
	D. Postpone surgery until she has been warfarinised for 3/12
	E. Postpone surgery until she has been warfarinised for 6/12

#### Answer: C. Continue surgery, start her on IV heparin - TRUE
- This is a difficult situation
	- Delaying surgery will almost certainly lead to widespread metastatic spread of her cancer
	- Concurrent DVT will increase her mortality risk from GA
- The options should be discussed in detail with the patient
- IV heparin makes it easier to reverse her coagulopathic state
	- Careful haemostatis will ensure minimal bleeding
