### Q1 (E) #36865
A 36-yo man is admitted to ITU having sustained 60% total body surface area burns.

What is the best method of monitoring his fluid requirements?

	A. Blood pressure
	B. Heart rate
	C. JVP
	D. Temperature
	E. Urine output
	
#### Answer: B. Heart rate - *FALSE*
E. Urine output - TRUE
- The aim of fluid resuscitation is to preserve end organ function
- Urine output should be maintained at **0.5 mL/kg/hr** (and double that in children)
	- Fluid resuscitation is guided by this metric
- **Parklands formula** will give an estimate of fluid requirement in first 24-hrs post burn injury

### Q2 (E) #36866
A 34-yo man is admitted with an ulnar-sided wrist laceration having fallen onto glass whilst intoxicated.

Which of the following is a sign of ulnar nerve transection?

	A. Loss of flexor digiti minimi (FDM) function
	B. Loss of the index finger flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) function
	C. Loss of sensation in the radial 3 digits
	D. Loss of sensation over the 1st dorsal web space
	E. Loss of thumb abduction
	
#### Answer: A. Loss of flexor digiti minimi function - TRUE
- In the forearm, Ulnar Nerve supplies
	1. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (FCU) 
	2. Medial half of Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP) 
- In the hand, if gives off a superficial and deep branch
- Deep branch supplies
	1. Hyothenar muscles
	2. Opponens Digiti Minimi (ODM)
	3. Adbuctor Digiti Minini (ADM)
	4. Flexor Digiti Minimi (FDM)
	5. Third and Fourth Lubrical Muscles
	6. Dorsal and Palmar Interossei
	7. Adductor Pollicis
	8. Deep Head of Flexor Pollicis Brevis
- Superficial branches supplies
	1. Palmaris Brevis 

### Q3 (A) #36867
A 32-yo man develops an acutely painful arm having sustained a closed fracture of his distal radius 8-hrs previously. He was Tx with cast immoblisation.

What os the most likely underlying diagnosis?
	A. Compartment syndrome
	B. Deep vein thrombosis
	C. Early infection
	D. Inadequate analgesia
	E. Necrotising fascitis
	
#### Answer: A. Compartment syndrome - TRUE
- Compartment syndrome is characterised by pain out of proportion with the injury
- Pallor, parathesia and pulselessness (3Ps) occur in the late stages
- Dx is on clinical grounds, although compartment pressures can be measured
- Raised creatine kinase (CK) is indicative of **muscle necrosis** 
- Treatment
	- Perform early **Fasciotomies** to release deep and superficial compartments
	- Wounds may subsequently need to be skin grafted

### Q4 (A) #36868
A 25-yo man is admitted having cut his flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) on a piece of glass.

Which of the following is the FDP attached to?

	A. Clelands ligament
	B. Graysons ligament
	C. The base of the distal phalynx
	D. The base of the middle phalynx
	E. The base of the proximal phalynx
	
#### Answer: C. The base of the distal phalynx - TRUE
- FDP originates from 
	1. Upper 3/4 of the anterior + medial surfaces of the ulna
	2. Interosseous membrane
	3. Deep fascia of the forearm
- One tendon is given off to each of the fingers
	- These insert onto the **Palmar Base of the Distal Phalynx**	
### Q5 (A) #36869
A 67-yo man undergoes split thickness skin grafting for a full thickness burn to his back.

What is the best description of a split thickness skin graft?

	A. Takes a variable amount of epidermis, leaving behind the epidermal appendages
	B. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis
	C. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis and underlying fat
	D. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis, underlying fat and fascia
	E. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis, fat, fascia and a cuff of muscle
	
#### Answer: A. Takes a variable amount of epidermis, leaving behind the epidermal appendages - TRUE
- A split skin graft (SSG) takes the epidermis from the donor area, leaving behind skin appendages 
	- So that the area is able to heal by secondary intention
- Graft is avascular
	- Relies on **neovascularisation** at recipient site
	- This takes between 5 and 7 days
- In order for the graft to 'take' at its new site, wound bed must be
	1. Clean
	2. Vascularised
	3. Free of infection

### Q6 (A) #36870
A 2-yo child is admitted to paediatric ED with malaise, rash, vomiting and fever. Mum reports that she has been off her food for the preceding 24-hrs and has been running a low-grade temperature. She also points to a partial thickness burn over her arm that has been de-roofed and Tx with dressings by her GP.

What is the likely Dx?

	A. Anaphylaxis
	B. Haemophilus influenza
	C. Meningococcal septicaemia
	D. Salmonella
	E. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)

#### Answer: E. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) - TRUE
- An unwell child with an unhealed burn must be treated for TSS until proven otherwise
- Treatment is with ITU, paediatric and plastic surgery input
- Circulatory support with cryoprecipitate may be necessary
