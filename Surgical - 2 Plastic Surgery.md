	E. Takes the entire thickness of the dermis, fat, fascia and a cuff of muscle
	
#### Answer: A. Takes a variable amount of epidermis, leaving behind the epidermal appendages - TRUE
- A split skin graft (SSG) takes the epidermis from the donor area, leaving behind skin appendages 
	- So that the area is able to heal by secondary intention
- Graft is avascular
	- Relies on **neovascularisation** at recipient site
	- This takes between 5 and 7 days
- In order for the graft to 'take' at its new site, wound bed must be
	1. Clean
	2. Vascularised
	3. Free of infection

	A. Axillary nerve
	B. Median nerve
	C. Musculocutaneous nerve
	D. Radial nerve
	E. Ulnar nerve

#### Answer: B. Median nerve - TRUE
- Formed by the lateral and medial cord of the brachial plexus
	- Median Nerve has contribution rom C6, C7, C8 and T1
- It enters the Hand via the Carpal Tunnel
	- Anatomical compression in this area can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome
- Just as it exits the tunnel
	- Median Nerve gives off the _Recurrent Motor Branch_
	- Avoid damaging this in surgical release of the flexor retinaculum

### Q8 (A) #36872
A 79-yo lady attends A&E having collapsed onto a radiator. She has a full thickness burn to her buttock.

	D. Involve the reticular dermis, white in appearance, does not blanch. Likely to heal within 8-weeks with resultant scarring and contractures
	E. None of he above

#### Answer: A. Extends through the entire dermis, and has a black, eschar appearance. Painless - TRUE
- Full-thickness burns will need a prolonged time to heal 
	- Excision and grafting is advocated where patients are medically fit to tolerate a short anaesthetic
- Elderly patients with co-morbidities

	D. Thoracoacromial artery
	E. Thoracodorsal artery

#### Answer: E. Thoracodorsal artery - TRUE
- Thoracodorsal Artery us a branch of the Subscapular Artery
	- Supplied Latissimus Dorsi
- The muscle is raised high into the axilla with protection of the neurovascular bundle
	- A skin paddle is taken with it
	- The Serratus Branch is often clipped and dividied
- The muscle is then passed through the axilla from the back to reach the front
	- Flap can be monitored by pressing on skin paddle to assess capillary refill
- Failure rates are low given that this is a pedicled flap
	- **No microvascular anastomic** connections

### Q13 (A) #36878
A 67-y lady with a recently excised malignant melanoma of the leg returns to clinic with a palpable groin lump suggestive of lymphadenopathy.

What is the next step in her management?

	A. CT scan
	B. FNA
	C. Groin dissection
	D. Open node biopsy
	E. PET scan
	
#### Answer: E. PET scan - *FALSE*
B. FNA (fine needle aspiration biopsy)
- She should have an FNA for cytology
	- May be done under USS if the node is small
- If the results are inconclusive, discuss option of open node biopsy
- If positive, she will require elective groin dissection with whole body CT scan
- **Little evidence** to suggest than removal of pelvis lymph nodes _reduces mortality_

### Q14 (A) # 36879
A 78-yo lady is awaiting a right-side groin dissection for metastatic spread of melanoma. During her perioperative investigations she is noted to have a DVT in her right leg.

What should happen next in this case?

	A. Cancel surgery and monitor her progress with 3/12 CT scans
	B. Continue surgery, keep her on warfarin
	C. Continue surgery, start her on IV heparin
	D. Postpone surgery until she has been warfarinised for 3/12
	E. Postpone surgery until she has been warfarinised for 6/12

#### Answer: C. Continue surgery, start her on IV heparin - TRUE
- This is a difficult situation
	- Delaying surgery will almost certainly lead to widespread metastatic spread of her cancer
	- Concurrent DVT will increase her mortality risk from GA
- The options should be discussed in detail with the patient
- IV heparin makes it easier to reverse her coagulopathic state
	- Careful haemostatis will ensure minimal bleeding

**BSA** = body surface area

#### S1
A 70kg mechanical engineer sustains a mixture of partial and full thickness burns to his lower limbs (< 5% BSA, full-thickness) from a fractured pipe leaking pressurised steam. You calculate that he has 14% BSA total burns. Assuming that the patient is being assessed in a burns unit, what rate of fluid resuscitation is recommended?

##### Answer: F. 2 to 4 Ringer's lactate solution in 8-hr, transfer to burns unit - **FALSE**
C. 1 to 2 Ringer's lactate solution in 8-hr

- By calculation: 2-4 mL x 70 x 14 = 2-4 L over 24hr → 1-2 L over 8hr
- Patient does not meet the guidelines for transfer
	- **Adult**
		- > 20% BSA total burns (2nd or 3rd degree), or 
		- > 5% BSA full-thickness (3rd degree)
- Other criteria for an adult include
	- Injuries to a specific body area
		- Eyes, ears, face
		- Hands, genitalia
		- Associated inhalation injury
	- Specific types of burn
		- Electrical
		- Certain chemical

#### S2
A 9-yo child weighing 35kg sustains 14% blistering burns to the upper limbs while trying to 'torch' a dumped car on his council estate.

##### Answer: D. 1 to 2 Ringer's lactate solution in 8-hr, transfer to burns unit - **FALSE**
B. 0.5 to 1 Ringer's lactate solution in 8-hr, transfer to burns unit - TRUE

- By calculation: 2-4 mL x 35 x 14 = 1-2 L over 24hr → 0.5-1 L over 8hr
- Any child (< 10 years) with partial or full-thickness burns > 10% BSA
	- Should be referred to a burns unit

#### S3
A 27-yo 70kg man is rescued by the fire service from a house fire. He has extensive partial and full-thickness burns covering the front and back of the trunk, and the front and back of one lower limb.

##### Answer: H. 4 to 8 Ringer's lactate solution in 8-hr, transfer to burns unit - TRUE
- **Rule of Nines** used to calculate BSA affected by burns
	- Head: 9% (1)
	- Front/Back Trunk: 18% (2x2 = 4)
	- Lower Limb: 18% (2x2 = 4)
	- Upper Limb: 9% (2x1 = 2)
	- Perineum: 1%
- Patient has (trunk) 2x18% + (one lower limb) 1x18% = 54%
	- Fluid requirement: 2-4 mL x 70 x 54 = 8-16 L in 24hr → 4-8 L over 8hr
	- Patient _clearly_ requires transfer (54% >> 20%)
	
**Notes**
- Answer to Q relies on specific knowledge of 2 ares of burn management
	1. Fluid formula: 2-4 mL x kg x % BSA in 24hr (1/2 in **first** 8hr)
	2. American Burn Association guidelines for T/F to a burn center
