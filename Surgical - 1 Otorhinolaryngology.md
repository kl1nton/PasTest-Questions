### Q1 (A)

An unimmunised 2-year-old child is brought to the ED by her patents with a 1-day Hx of a sore throat. On examination the child is drooling, with noisy breathing and a temperature of 39.4C

What is the most likely causative organism?

	A. Group C streptococcus
	B. Haemophilus influenzae type B
	C. Moraxella catarrhalis
	D. Neisseria meningitidis
	E. Staphylococcus aureus
	
\#37440

#### Answer: B. Haemophilus influenzae type B - TRUE

- The child in this scenario has acute epiglottitis
- Acute epiglottitis tends to present with a rapidly progressive sore
	- In the late stages, the patient may have associated inspiratory stridor
- The child will be toxic, with a raised temperature and tends to sit forward in the tripod position and drool
- Peak incidence is between 2-7 years

**Notes**
- All the bacteria listed are known to cause acute epiglotittis
	- However, some are more common in adults
- The comment cause in children has classically been _Haemophilus influenzae type B_ (HIB)
	- Accounting for approximately 90%
	- However, incidence has decreased due to **vaccination**
- Currently the commonest cause in children is _Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus_
- The most likely cause in this cases is _Haemophilus inflenzae type-B_ as the child has **not been immunised**

### Q2 

A 3-year-old boy presents to the ED with a severe sore throat, temperature of 38.7C and noisy breathing. The child is sat forward and drooling.

What is the most import first step you should perform in the management of this child?

	A. Examination of the oropharynx
	B. Flexible laryngoscopy
	C. IV access and blood cultures
	D. IV antibiotics
	E. Urgently call the paediatric anaesthetist
	
\#37441

#### Answer: C. IV access and blood cultures - FALSE	
	
E. Urgently call the paediatric anaesthetist - TRUE

- This child has acute epiglottitis
- Acute epiglottitis tends to present with a rapidly progressive sore
	- In the late stages, the patient may have associated inspiratory stridor
- The child will be toxic, with a raised temperature and tends to sit forward (in the tripod position) and drool

**Notes**
- The loose connective tissue swelling in the epiglottis can occlude the airway and care must be taken to avoid this
- **Any** attempts to examine the child, including simple cannulation _can precipitate laryngospasm and airway occlusion_
- There the **most important** step in managing this patient is to get the help of someone with experience in managing children's airways

### Q3 (A)

A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department. He is known to have chronic suppurative otitis media. He has a severe headache, fever and otorrhoea. He reports altered taste. On examination, he has pain on lateral rotation of the neck, and tenderness and oedema over the right mastoid. He is tachycardic.

What is the most likely complication of chronic suppurtative otitis media that he has?

	A. Cortical thrombophlebitis
	B. Extra-dural abscess
	C. Lateral sinus thrombosis
	D. Meningitis
	E. Subdural abscess
	
\#37442

#### Answer: E. Subdural abscess - *FALSE*
C. Lateral sinus thrombosis - **TRUE**

- Compression of CN IX, X and XI can also occur
	- This would alter the patient's taste in the posterior 3rd of the tongue - due to glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) compression
	- Can result in tachycardia - due to vagus nerve (CN X, _pneumogastric_) compression

**Definition** _Griesinger Sign_
- Erythema and edema over the posterior part of the mastoid process
- Due to septic thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein 
	- Indicating thrombophlebitis of the sigmoid sinus

### Q4 (A)

A 13-year-old boy, known to have sinusitis, presents to the ED with severe pain over the right side of his nose and right cheek. Over the last 24 hrs he has developed a fever and blurred vision.

\#4541

#### S1
A 55-year-old man has been referred with a history of sudden onset of vertigo accompanied by nausea and vomiting that gradually subsided over 24-hours but left him unsteady for 3-weeks. On direct questioning, he has noticed a hearing loss in his left ear and a period of tinnitus before the attack of vertigo. After the attack he noticed that his hearing had become worse. On examination, the abnormal finding was a left-sided sensorineural hearing loss, confirmed on audiometry.

##### Answer: 	K. Meniere's disease - TRUE
- Prosper Meniere (1799-1862) was a French ENT specialist, assistant of Baron Dupuytren
- The condition he described is characterised by '3Ds'
	1. Deafness
	2. Dizziness
	3. Tinnitius (Din)
- All patients presenting with vertigo should have
	1. Imaging to exclude an acoustic neuroma
		- Diagnosis would be more strongly suspected if evidence of cranial nerve/cerebellar dysfunction coexisted
	2. Testing for syphilis
		- Neurosyphilis may present in this way and must be treated

#### S2
A 45-year-old man presents with a 1-year history of foul-smelling purulent discharge from the left ear and increasing deafness. On examination after removal of the discharge, an attic perforation is visualised which is occupied by a greyish substance. Radiography reveals a sclerotic mastoid.

##### Answer: H. Chronic suppurative otitis - *FALSE*
F. Cholesteotoma - TRUE
- This is a form of chronic suppurative otitis media
- As a result of a marginal or attic perforation
	- There is chronic infection of the 
		1. Bone of the attic, antrum and mastoid process
		2. As well as the mucosa of the midle ear
- While the disease is less common that in pre-antibiotic times
	-It is an important disorder not to miss
- Cholesteotoma requires chronic treatment
	- Often including surgery (commonly mastoidectomy)
	- Numerous potentially serious extra- and intra-cranial complications
	
#### S3
A 20-year-old woman presents with a 1-year histoy of bilateral deafness and tinnitus. The deafness is worse on the left side and is less marked in places with background noise. The patient's father has worn a hearing aid since his late teens. On examination, the tympanic membranes are normal. Rinne's test is negative bilaterally, and Weber's test lateralises to the left side.

##### Answer: A. Acoustic neuroma - *FALSE*
M. Otosclerosis - TRUE
- This commonn disorder occurs in approximately 1/200 people (to some degree)
- It is common in women
	- Marked hereditary tendency in certain families

- Pathology is one of excessive bone formation in the middle ear
- Leads to conductive deafness
	1. Rinne: negative when bone conduction is superior to air	
	2. Weber: lateralises to the worse side
- Hearing is often improved in noisy places
	- So called _paracusis willisii_
- Note: tympanum appears normal in the majority of cases

#### S4
A 10-year-old child presents with rapid-onset, sever, right-sided otalgia and hearing loss following an upper respiratory tract infection. On examination, the right tympanic membrane appears red and bulges outwards.

##### Answer: Acute (serous) middle-ear media effusion - FALSE
C. Acute suppurative otitis media
- Taxonomy in this area is rather confusing, there being a variety of middle ear effusions described in terms of 
	1. Duration: acute vs chronic
	2. Presence/absence of infection: unspecified = serous vs suppurative
	3. Other factors
		- Aetiology: e.g. acute catarrhal otitis media
		- Glue Ear: chronic serous otitis media
- Examination: tympanic membrane is retracted in all _except_
	1. Acute Suppurative Otitis Media: **bulging**
	2. Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media: perforated

\#4542

#### S1
A 2-year-old child presents with bleeding from one side of the nose. His mother had noticed a foul-smelling discharge from the nose on that side for some months. This had only temporarily responded to courses of antibiotics. Examination of the nostrils shows an inflamed mucous membrane and a blood-stained mucopurulent discharge.

##### Answer: B. Foreign body - TRUE
- This may present with bleeding from the nose in the presence of long-standing inflammation
- The history of a foul-smelling nasal discharge and the age of the child should alert one to the diagnosis
	- Foreign bodies in the nose are commonest in children aged 2-3
- Treatment is by removal under general anaesthesia once inflammation is established as in this case
- If the problem is identified early
	- Various manoeuvres can be attempted in ED to blow out the offending foreign body

#### S2

- In this case, the patient is likely to be a regular user of cocaine
	- Now one of the most common causes of recurrent epistaxis
- The diagnosis is strongly suggested by
	1. Septal defect
	2. Dental problems
	3. Sinus problems
	4. Young adult

**Notes**
- Commonest causes of epistaxis are:
	1. Idiopathic (nose picking)

A 28-year-old reports hoarseness especially in the morning. This resolved gradually during the day. There is no history of vocal abuse. He smokes 10 cigarettes a day and drinks moderately. On indirect laryngoscopy both cords are slightly red but there are no focal abnormalities.
##### Answer: N. Tuberculous laryngitis - *FALSE*
C. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) - TRUE
- This is suggested by 
	1. Early diurnal hoarseness 
	2. Absence of any evident pathology on indirect laryngoscopy
- This is one example of non-infectious inflammatory changes of the vocal cords referred to as _chronic laryngitis_
- Other common causes are:
	1. Chronic cough
	2. Heavy smoking

#### S2
A 60-year-old lifelong heavy smoker reports rapid onset of hoarseness that has slightly improved while waiting for his ENT appointment. He has recently been investigated by the respiratory physicians for chronic cough with haemoptysis and weight loss. On examination he is clubbed.
##### Answer: E. Laryngeal carcinoma - *FALSE*
G. Neurogenic: left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy - TRUE
- In this case this has arisen as a result of Carcinoma of the Left Bronchus (see other S+S)
- Vocal cord paralysis arises as a rule from remote causes
	- Causes vary bilaterally as a result of differences in the anatomical course of the RLN
- Left RLN
	- Nerve loops around remnant of _Ductus Arteriosus_
	- Passing below Arch of the Aorta
	- Susceptible to **Left Hilar** pathologies
		1. Tumours
		2. Pulmonary surgery
		3. Left atrial enlargement
- Right RLN
	- Passes below Subclavian Artery
- Cord lines in the paramedian (ADducted) position in contrast to lesions of Vagus or SLN where
	- Cord lies in cadaveric (ABducted position)
	- Usually causing aphonia

#### S3
A 5-year-old boy is brought to ED with dyspnoea and stridor. His mother has noticed a change in his voice over the past 3 months. His GP has been treating his progressive dyspnoea as asthma. On examination of the vocal cords there are multiple small pedunculated lesions on the vocal cords that are pinkish white in colour.
##### Answer: B. Candidiasis of the larynx - **FALSE**
F. Laryngeal papilloma - TRUE
- Viral lesions that commonly arise between the ages of 2 and 5
- Must be removed with care
	- As they can easily spread to whole of larynx and trachea
- Laser removal (vaporises lesions) is treatment of choice
- The are said to disappear at puberty: exception rather than the rule
- Multiple papillomas are a cause of stridor and respiratory obstruction
	- Sometimes necessitating tracheostomy

**Notes**
- Dysphonia = impairment of voice; two categories
	1. Problems with projection of voice
	2. Problems with quality of voice
- The commonest of the later is hoarseness
	- Form of dysphonia defined as a rough or noisy quality of voice
	- Often used interchangeably with 'dysphonia'
- Causes of dysphonia can be divided into 2 categories
	1. **Damage to mucosal surface** of cords: e.g. inflammation, tumour
	2. Leading to **vocal cord paralysis**

- Also known as 'Croup' - caused by viral infection (parainfluenza 1)
	- Commonly affects 6-month to 3-year-old age group in winter months
- Stridor (and respiratory obstruction) is caused by subglottic oedema 
- Treatment
	1. Humidified air/oxygen in an incubator (or croupette)
	2. Supportive nasogastric/IV fluids
- IV ABx are used to cover for secondary bacterial infections (or tracheiti in severe cases)
- Scrupulous observation is required for signs of impending respiratory obstruction
	- Requiring nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy (if this fails)
	
**Notes**
- Croup is distinguished from acute epiglottitis where
	1. Child is usually older
	2. Presence of supraglottic oedema
		- Epiglottis is red and swollen
		- Protrused above the tongue: the 'rising sun' sign
- Diphtheria is a DDx in unimmunised populations

#### S2
An 18-year-old girl presents with facial oedema, dyspnoea and stridor. She is apyrexial and has no medical history, drug history or allergies.

##### Answer: C. Anaphylactic reaction - *FALSE*
D. Angioneurotic oedema - TRUE
- Condition of unknown aetiology most commonly affected young women
- Management
	1. Close observation
	2. Antihistamines
	3. IV steroids/epinephrine nebulisers
- Should condition deteriorate, patient may require orotracheal intubation

**Notes**
- Angioneurotic oedema is only distinguished from anaphylactic chock by _absence_ of a precipitating allergen (ABx, bee sting etc)

#### S3
A 25-year-old fireman is rescued by his colleagues after becoming trapped by falling debris in a burning building. He is alert and oriented but has stridor, hoarseness and a cough productive of black sputum. He has burns to the face and upper torso.

##### Answer: J. Inhalation or ingestion of irritants - TRUE
- In this case the patient has smoke inhalation with burns to the upper airway
- Supraglottic airway is extremely susceptible to obstruction as a result of exposure to heat
- When a patient is admitted after burn injury
	- Must **always** be alert to possibility of airway involvement
- Clinical indications of inhalation injury include
	1. Facial burns
	2. Singeing of the nasal hairs
	3. Carbon deposits in the oropharynx
	4. Carbonaceous sputum
	5. Hoarseness
	6. Carboxyhaemoglobin level > 10%
- Stridor is an indication for _immediate_ orotracheal intubation
	- Should have electively intubated patient before sign is present
- Similar pattern of airway obstruction can be caused by ingestion of corrosives, such as strong acids/alkalis

#### S1
A 49-year-old man attends ED with severe, sudden onset submandibular pain. Over the last few weeks he has experiences similar pain precipitated by eating, but never as severe as this. Past history includes hypertension. On examination, he is afebrile and there is diffuse submandibular swelling that is only minimally tender on palpation.

##### Answer: E. Sialolithiasis - TRUE
- Calculi can occur in the submandibular or parotid glands
	- The former (submandibular) is most commonly affected
- Predisposing factors include
	1. Chronic sialadenitis
	2. Reduced salivary flow rates
	3. Dehydration
	4. Duct obstruction
- Calculi are associated with
	1. Diabetes mellitus
	2. Hypertension
	3. Chronic liver disease
- A stone within a gland may be asymptomatic
	- Whereas a stone in the duct is likely to cause painful swelling that is precipitated by eating
- Acute suppurative sialadenitis may supervene
	- Characterised by fever and severe pain
	- May give rise to spasm of adjacent muscles of mastication
		- Leading to 'trismus'
		- Such a patient may be toxic

**Notes**
- 20% of submandibular (66% of parotid) are radiolucent
	- Sialography is indicated to demonstrate filling defects
- Stones may be removed surgically 
	- Distal stones: lithotomy 
	- Proximal stones: excision of the duct with the gland

#### S2
A 32-year-old woman is referred to clinic with parotidomegaly. She reports intermittent painless welling over the last few months. Past medical history includes hypothyroidism and chronic back pain for which she takes thyroxine 100µg and co-proxaol, respectively. On examination, there is soft enlargement of the parotid gland. 

##### Answer: H. Viral parotitis - *FALSE*
F. Sialosis - TRUE
- Sialosis refers to recurrent swelling of the salivary gland
	- In the **absence** of neoplasia or inflammation
- The swelling is typically painless and bilateral
- An important distinguishing feature from other causes of parotidomegaly 
	- Gland, although enlarged, remains soft and not indurated
- Sialosis occurs in association with 
	1. Endocrine disorders
		- Myxoedema
		- Cushing's disease
		- Diabetes mellitus
	2. Metabolic disturbances
		- Nutritional disorders
		- Vitamin deficiencies 
	3. Certain drugs, including 
		- Dextropropoxyphene (co-proxamol)
		- Oral contraceptive pill (OCP)
		- Anti-psychotics
		- Clonidine

#### S3
A 50-year-old woman presents with a recent history of dry mouth. On direct questioning she reports irritations of her eyes, although she denies arthralgia. There is no relevant past medical or drug history. Clinical examination of the salivary glands is unremarkable. FBC is normal, but ESR and CRP are both grossly elevated.
##### Answer: G. Sjogren's syndrome - TRUE
- The salivary glands may be damaged by autoimmune disease
- Primary Sjogren's syndrome is characterised by the presence of 2 of the following triad
	1. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes)
	2. Xerostomia (dry mouth)
	3. Rheumatoid arthritis, or other connective tissue disorder e.g.
		- Scleroderma
		- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
		- Polyarteritis nodosa
- The clinical scenario presented describes a patient with primary Sjogren's syndrome
	- Xerostomia + Xerophthalmia with **no** connective tissue component
- By contrast, secondary Sjogren's syndrome refers to the presence of all three features

**Notes**
- The main differential in 'at risk' groups is that of HIV-associated sialadenitis
	- Which is clinically indistinguishable
- The diagnosis should be considered especially in female patients
	- Sjogren's has a female predominance of 10:1
- Mikulicz's syndrome is also an automimmune syndrome that describes
	1. Enlargement of the salivary glands
	2. Xerostomia
	3. Enlargement of the lacrimal glands causing
		- Bulge below the outer end of the eyelids
		- Narrowing in the palpebral fissures

#### S1
A 47-year-old man is referred to clinic with unilateral swelling affecting the right parotid gland. He reports painless swelling, increasing in size over the last few years. Examination confirms intact facial nerve function, although inspection of the mouth reveals displacement of the right tonsil and pillar of the fauces towards the midline.
##### Answer: G. Monomorphic adenoma (Warthin's tumour) - FALSE
I. Pleomorphic adenoma - TRUE
- Tumour is a slow-growing lesion that comprises glandular and stromal elements
	- Does **not** have a true capsule, but a pseudo-capsule resulting from fibrosis of the abjacent compressed salivary tissue
- Multiple projects extending through 'defects' in the pseudo-capsule into the normal surrounding tissue prevent treatment by enucleation
- Clinically, pleomorphic adenomas present as slow-growing painless masses
- There is _rarely_ disruption of the Facial Nerve
	- Although location in the deep part of the gland may displace adjacent structures inside the mouth
- Diagnosis is confirmed by fine-needle aspiration

**Notes**
- Such tumours should be removed by parotidectomy
	- Superficial: tumour in superficial lobe of the gland
	- Total + preservation of Facial Nerve: when tumour involved deep part of gland
- Tumours in submandibular gland should be treated by excision of the gland

#### S2
A 61-year-old woman has been referred urgently by her GP with a history of painful swelling of the right parotid gland. She has recently developed facial nerve palsy on the right side. Examination reveals a cystic mass that os fixed over the parotid gland, and associated cervical lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates the presence of atypical mucous cells.
##### Answer: H. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma - TRUE
- This is the **most common malignant** salivary gland tumour
- Associated pain is not a reliable indicator of malignancy
	- But pain **is** associated with a worse prognosis in _proven malignancy_
- Presentation with facial nerve involvement is **very suggestive** of a malignant tumour
**Notes**
- 25% of patients have associated lymphadenopathy at time of presentation
- Histologically, the tumour is composed of epidermoid cells & mucous cells
	- Which secrete mucus into the stroma of the tumour
	- Giving rise to its cystic nature
- Tumours may be graded as high- or low- grade
	- Although their biological behaviour tends to be unpredictable
- 10-yr survival rates for high/low grade tumours
	- High-grade: 40%
	- Low-grade: 80%

#### S3
A 71year-old man presents with swelling of the left parotid gland. Examination reveals a non-tender enlargement of the left parotid gland, with bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. These is intact facial nerve function. FBC: Hb = 8.8 g/dL, WCC = 2.2 x 10^9^/L, PLT: 45 x 10^9^/L
##### Answer: E. Lymphoma - TRUE
- Primary salivary gland lymphomas are uncommon
	- Accounting for 10% of all salivary gland malignancies
	- The majority tend to be **non**-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
- Patients with non-Hodgkin's usually present with localised or generalised **non**-tender lymphadenopathy
- ~40% of patients have bone marrow involvement at presentation
	- Resulting in cytopenia
	- May be associated splenic or hepatic involvement

#### S1
A 37-year-old man presents with a new lump in his neck that on examination is situated in the left carotid triangle, and appears to be deep to the upper third of the SCM. It feels firm and cystic on palpation. Aspiration reveals 10 mL of thick yellow fluid. He is otherwise fit and well.
##### Answer: D. Cystic hygroma - *FALSE*
A. Branchial cyst - TRUE
- Branchial cysts is a remnant of, usually the **second** branchial cleft
- It is lined by squamous epithelium and if infected, a small sinus may develop tracking to the ski at the anterior border of the SCM
- Presentation is often as this scenario
	- Cyst arising from the junction between upper and middle 1/3rds of SCM
- Treatment is surgical excision with concomitant ABx treatment of any pore-existing infection
- Care must be taken to excise the entire cyst to prevent recurrence
	- It is not necessary to trace and excise andy tract to the pharynx
- Patients must be made fully aware of and five full consent 
	- Regarding risks of damage to accessory, vagus and hypogossal nerves
- Rarely a chronically infected cyst may become adherent to the internal jugular vein (IJV)

#### S2
An 80-year-old woman presents with a history of dysphagia, halitosis, regurgitation and recurrent chest infections. She is otherwise well.
##### Answer: F. Pharyngeal pouch - TRUE
- Also known as Zenker's diverticulum
	- Often present in the elderly where they have had the opportunity to develop without many Sx
	- Patients eventually complain as in this scenario with dysphagia and subsequent weight loss
- Pulmonary overspill occurs
	- Hoarseness and recurrent chest infections may be the only presenting feature
- A low, anterior triangular mass may be felt and fluid within the pouch can sometimes be displaced on deeper palpation
- Aetiology is unknown
	- Imaging studies suggest a neuromuscular incoordination resulting in herniation of the mucosa through the muscular coat
- Weakest point is **Killian's dehiscence** between the thyropharyngeal and cricopharyngeal muscles
	- Constitute the _inferior constrictor muscle_
- Management: surgical excision using open or endoscopic technique

#### S3
A 4-month-old infant is brought to clinic with a unilateral swelling on the right side of the neck, The child is noted to posture her head awkwardly, She is otherwise well but her mother reports that she was born by a difficult forceps delivery for a breech presentation.
##### Answer: A. Branchial cyst - *FALSE*
G. Sternocleidomastoid tumour - TRUE
- These appear 1-2 months after birth
	- Usually accompanied by a history of a complicated or breech birth
- The 'tumour' is unilateral situated as described in this scenario
	- It is initially a haematoma with associated muscle degeneration
	- It is often tender at first and associated with torticollis
- Early treatment is imperative - to prevent permanent disability
	- Active + passive stimulation: achieved at home by infant's parents
- This normally reduceds the 'tumour' over the first 4-6 months
	- Late presentation or failure to respond to conservative treatment require surgery

#### S4
A 20-year-old woman presents with an asymptomatic painless lump in the midline below her chin. The lump is smooth, measures 1cm, is non-tender and moves on swallowing
##### Answer: I. Thyroglossal cyst - TRUE
-  gut

**Notes**
- When considering neck lumps, it may be helpful to consider the anatomy of the neck and its sub-division into anterior and posterior triangles
- However, it is the Editor's view that, in practice, there is a broad division into three
	1. Lymphadenopathy (cervical or supraclavicular): lateral and common
	2. Thyroid lumps/enlargement (and thyroid gland cyst): midline and common
	3. Oddities (often embryologic): lateral and rare
